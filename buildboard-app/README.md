# Explanation

BuildBoard is a modern, React-based dashboard designed to give development and DevOps teams a unified, real-time view of builds and deployments across multiple Azure DevOps projects and environments. It aggregates build status, commit history, and deployment progress, making it easy to monitor, audit, and manage CI/CD pipelines from a single, user-friendly interface. With features like environment filtering, direct pipeline access, and responsive design, BuildBoard streamlines collaboration and boosts deployment confidence for teams of any size.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Solutions and Benefits

## Solutions
- Provides a unified dashboard for monitoring builds and deployments across multiple Azure DevOps projects and environments.
- Simplifies tracking of build status, commit history, and deployment progress for development and DevOps teams.
- Enables quick identification of issues and bottlenecks in CI/CD pipelines by surfacing real-time build and commit data.
- Centralizes access to Azure Pipeline links, making it easy to investigate or trigger builds directly from the dashboard.

## Benefits
- Saves time by eliminating the need to navigate multiple Azure DevOps project pages.
- Improves team collaboration and communication with a single source of truth for build and deployment status.
- Enhances traceability and auditability by showing recent PRs/commits and their authors for each build.
- Increases deployment confidence by making environment-specific build data easily accessible and filterable.
- Supports better release planning and coordination by providing visibility into all environments (Dev, Test, Prod, UAT, etc.).

# Use Cases

## 1. Real-Time Build Monitoring
Developers and DevOps engineers can use the dashboard to monitor the status of builds and deployments across multiple projects and environments (Dev, Test, Prod, UAT, etc.) in real time. The dashboard fetches the latest build and commit information from Azure DevOps, providing instant feedback on the health of CI/CD pipelines.

## 2. Environment-Based Filtering
Users can filter projects by environment using the dropdown in the header. This allows teams to focus on specific deployment stages (e.g., only view UAT or DEV5 builds) and quickly identify issues or progress in the relevant context.

## 3. Traceability and Audit
The dashboard displays the last 10 PRs/commits for each project, including author, message, timestamp, and commit links. This enables teams to trace changes, audit deployments, and understand what code changes are included in each build.

## 4. Centralized Pipeline Access
Each project tile includes a direct link to its Azure Pipeline, making it easy for users to jump to the pipeline for more details, logs, or to trigger new builds.

## 5. Team Collaboration
By providing a single view of all projects and environments, the dashboard helps teams collaborate, share status updates, and coordinate releases more effectively.

## Project Overview
Build a React-based dashboard called "Build Board - Azure DevOps Dashboard" that displays the latest builds and deployments for multiple projects, integrating with Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines. The dashboard should allow filtering by environment (e.g., Dev, Test, Prod, UAT, etc.) and show project names, build statuses, commit histories, and other relevant metadata.
